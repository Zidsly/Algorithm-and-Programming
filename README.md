# Implementation Algorithm System in BPJS Kesehatan

## Project Overview
This project focuses on the implementation of an algorithmic system in the Information Technology framework of **BPJS Kesehatan**. The project involves the development of flowcharts, pseudocode, and conducting dry runs to ensure the accuracy and efficiency of the designed system.

---

## System Summary
**BPJS Kesehatan** is an organization that provides health insurance services, including:
- Drug services
- Medical devices
- Medical materials

The goal of this project is to optimize the system design by leveraging algorithmic approaches to enhance the efficiency and reliability of the organization's operations.

Key components of the project include:
1. **Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD):**  
   - A visual representation of the database structure, showcasing the relationships between entities.
   
2. **Pseudocode:**  
   - A step-by-step description of the system's logic and processes in a human-readable format.

3. **Dry Run:**  
   - Manual simulation of the algorithm to verify its correctness and identify potential issues.

## Tools or Technology Stack
- **Draw.io:**  
  Used for creating flowcharts and ERD diagrams.
  
- **Microsoft Word 2016:**  
  Used for documenting the pseudocode and system analysis.
  
- **Notepad:**  
  Utilized for writing and testing simple code snippets or drafts.
